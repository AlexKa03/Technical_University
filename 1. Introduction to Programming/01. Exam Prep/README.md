3. Exercise
   - Sum of the variable from for loop

4. Exercise
   - Enter random input and print for each letter ther char code

5. Exercise
   - Write an application that finds the sum of the first N number of targets positive numbers. N is a positive integer that is introduced by the user. 

6. Exercise
   - Write an application that finds the sum of the first N number of targets positive numbers that divide without a remainder by the number M. N and M are integers positive
     numbers that are entered by the user.

7. Exercise
   - Write an application that prints the Fibunacci sequence up to the nth consecutive number, where n is entered by the user and is positive number. The first two numbers are 0        
     and 1, and each subsequent one is found by summing the the previous 2.
 
         n = 1 -> f(n) = 0
         n = 2 -> f(n) = 1
         n > 2 -> f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)

8. Exercise
   - Write a program that prints on the screen all the natural ones three-digit numbers that are multiples of the sum of their digits. The program should display their total
     number.
   - Example: 102 has a sum of 3 digits, and 102 is divisible by 3 without a remainder

9. Exercise
   - Write an application that prints to the screen all prime numbers in the interval [M,N]. M and N are entered by theuser.
   - A number is prime if it is divisible without a remainder only by 1 and itself.

             1

          4444
         55555

11. Exercise
