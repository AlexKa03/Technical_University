# Exam Prep 2

1. Exercise
   - Find which number is smallest and print it's value.

2. Exercise
   - Passing arguments by value.

3. Exercise
   - When using reference is like giving your friend a toy, if he breaks is, its broken.In programing that means if i make a change in the function using reference it will be          reflected in the original variable passed in the calling code.

4. Exercise
   - The out keyword in C# is used to pass a variable by reference to a method, but unlike the ref keyword, it does not require the variable to be initialized before passing it to      the method.
   - Think of it like this: when you go to a store and buy something, the cashier gives you a receipt as proof of purchase. The receipt has the same information as the item you        bought, but you didn't have to bring it with you to the store.

5. Exercise
   -  Calculate Factorial
   -  In Recursive and Iterative way

6. Exercise
   - Print first and last name.

7. Exercise
   - Read two integer numbers and swap them.

8. Exercise
   - Read two numbers. Find what it is equal to when divided by each other, and what will be their remainder between them.

9. Exercise
   - Read two integer numbers. Sum them and print them. Every action needs to have it's function.

         Hint:
         SumAndPrint
         Sum
         PrintResult

10. Exercise
    - Write a program with iterative function named "PowerI", which calculate the value of number m, raised to the power of n. Call the function with example parameters.

11. Exercise
    - Write a program with recursive function named "PowerR", which calculate the value of number m, raised to the power of n. Call the function with example parameters.

12. Exercise
    - Write a function called "IsPrime", that determines whether a given number is prime.

13. Exercise
    - Write a function that lets the user enter a positive integer a number and returns that number as the result.
